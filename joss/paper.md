# Summary

<!-- A summary describing the high-level functionality and purpose of the software for a diverse, non-specialist audience. -->

`taurex-emcee` is a plugin for the TauREx 3.1 atmospheric retrieval framework [@Al-Refaie:2021] that extends the choice of sampling methods available to the user. The plugin implements an interface to the [emcee](https://emcee.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) sampler [@Foreman-Mackey:2013], which is a popular affine-invariant ensemble sampler widely used in the astronomy community. The interface is automated by adopting the [autoemcee](https://github.com/JohannesBuchner/autoemcee) package by Johannes Buchner, which also handles parallelization. Thus, the `taurex-emcee` plugin enables users to launch parallelized retrievals using the emcee sampler in a straightforward manner. This allows fast retrievals of exoplanet atmospheric spectra, especially when coupled with the GPU-accelerated forward models of the TauREx 3.1 framework [@Al-Refaie:2020].

Optimized sampling methods are a key component of any retrieval code. Nested samplers [@Feroz:2009; @Feroz:2019] are a powerful and robust sampling method, successfully applied to the retrieval of exoplanet atmospheric spectra [@Changeat:2020; @Barstow:2020; @Bocchieri:2023]. TauREx 3.1 natively implements a suite of nested samplers, including the [MultiNest](https://github.com/JohannesBuchner/MultiNest) sampler, or makes them available as plugins, such as the [UltraNest](https://github.com/JohannesBuchner/UltraNest) sampler. The primary target of nested samplers is the efficient calculation of the Bayesian `evidence`, whilst the inference of the `posterior` is a by-product. This is regarded as a key advantage of nested samplers, as the `evidence` can be readily used for model selection. However, the `evidence` is not always required, and the interpretation of the `posterior` from nested samplers necessitates some care. Additionally, algorithmic assumptions of nested samplers may require to tailor the priors to explore the parameter space thoroughly.

Where the inference of the Bayesian `posterior` is the primary target, a well-established alternative to nested samplers are a family of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods known as affine-invariant ensemble samplers [@Goodman:2010]. The implementation in [emcee](https://emcee.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) [@Foreman-Mackey:2013] is a popular choice in the astronomy community, as it takes care of the heavy lifting of the sampling process, is well documented, and is straightforward to utilize. To date, the `emcee` sampler is not natively implemented in the TauREx 3.1 retrieval framework. To fill this gap, we developed the `taurex-emcee` plugin, which interfaces the `emcee` sampler to TauREx 3.1, expanding the choice of sampling methods available to the user.

<!-- Compared to nested samplers, affine-invariant ensemble samplers sample directly from the Bayesian `posterior`, and therefore the interpretation of the results is more straightforward, even for non-expert users. Moreover, in some instances nested samplers may require to define bespoke priors to ensure that the parameter space is thoroughly explored, whereas affine-invariant ensemble samplers asymptotically sample the entire parameter space. The trade-off being that the latter are more computationally expensive, and the computational time scales much faster with dimensionality. -->
