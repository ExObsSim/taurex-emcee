# Summary

<!-- A summary describing the high-level functionality and purpose of the software for a diverse, non-specialist audience. -->

`taurex-emcee` is a plugin for the TauREx 3.1 atmospheric retrieval framework [@Al-Refaie:2021] that extends the choice of sampling methods available to the user. The plugin implements an interface to the [emcee](https://emcee.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) sampler [@Foreman-Mackey:2013], which is a popular affine-invariant ensemble sampler widely used in the astronomy community. The interface is automated by adopting the [autoemcee](https://github.com/JohannesBuchner/autoemcee) package by Johannes Buchner, which also handles parallelization. Thus, the `taurex-emcee` plugin enables users to launch parallelized retrievals using the emcee sampler with a single line of code. This allows fast retrievals of exoplanet atmospheric spectra, especially when coupled with the GPU-accelerated forward models of the TauREx 3.1 framework [@Al-Refaie:2020].

# Statement of need

<!-- A Statement of need section that clearly illustrates the research purpose of the software and places it in the context of related work. -->

Optimized sampling methods are a key component of any retrieval code. Nested samplers [@Feroz:2008; @Feroz:2009; @Feroz:2013; @Feroz:2019] are generally considered the most robust sampling method for retrieval of exoplanet atmospheric spectra, and are natively implemented in TauREx 3.1 or available as plugins. The estimation of the Bayesian `evidence` is the primary product of nested samplers, whereas the estimation of the Bayesian `posterior` is a by-product. Compared to nested samplers, affine-invariant ensemble samplers sample directly from the Bayesian `posterior`, and therefore the interpretation of the results is more straightforward, even for non-expert users. Moreover, in some instances nested samplers may require to define bespoke priors to ensure that the parameter space is thoroughly explored, whereas affine-invariant ensemble samplers asymptotically sample the entire parameter space. The trade-off being that the latter are more computationally expensive, and the computational time scales much faster with dimensionality.

The [emcee](https://emcee.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) sampler is a popular affine-invariant ensemble sampler that is widely used in the astronomy community. However, TauREx 3.1 does not natively implement the emcee sampler. The `taurex-emcee` plugin implements the emcee sampler in TauREx 3.1, allowing users to perform retrievals using the emcee sampler. The `taurex-emcee` plugin is compatible with the TauREx 3.1 parallelization framework, allowing users to perform parallelized retrievals using the emcee sampler.
