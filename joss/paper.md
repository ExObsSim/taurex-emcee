# Summary

<!-- A summary describing the high-level functionality and purpose of the software for a diverse, non-specialist audience. -->

The `taurex-emcee` plugin is a plugin for the TauREx~3.1 retrieval code that allows users to perform retrievals using the emcee sampler. 

# Statement of need

<!-- A Statement of need section that clearly illustrates the research purpose of the software and places it in the context of related work. -->

Optimized sampling methods are a key component of any retrieval code. Nested samplers are generally considered the most robust sampling method for retrieval of exoplanet atmospheric spectra, and are natively implemented in TauREx~3.1. The estimation of the Bayesian `evidence` is the primary product of nested samplers, whereas the estimation of the Bayesian `posterior` is a by-product. Compared to nested samplers, affine-invariant ensemble samplers sample directly from the Bayesian `posterior`, and therefore the interpretation of the results is more straightforward, even for non-expert users. Moreover, in some instances nested samplers may require to define bespoke priors to ensure that the parameter space is thoroughly explored, whereas affine-invariant ensemble samplers asymptotically sample the entire parameter space. The trade-off being that the latter are more computationally expensive, and the computational time scales much faster with dimensionality.

The emcee sampler is a popular affine-invariant ensemble sampler that has been used in many fields of astronomy, including exoplanet atmospheric retrievals. The emcee sampler is a popular affine-invariant ensemble sampler that has been used in many fields of astronomy, including exoplanet atmospheric retrievals. The emcee sampler is implemented in the Python package [emcee](https://emcee.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), which is widely used in the astronomy community. However, the emcee sampler is not implemented in the TauREx~3.1 retrieval code, which is a popular open-source code for exoplanet atmospheric retrievals. The `taurex-emcee` plugin implements the emcee sampler in TauREx~3.1, allowing users to perform retrievals using the emcee sampler. The `taurex-emcee` plugin is compatible with the TauREx~3.1 parallelization framework, allowing users to perform parallelized retrievals using the emcee sampler.
